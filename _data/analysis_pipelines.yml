  description: "This repository provides computational workflows and standardized data deliverables for the processing, reformatting, and curation of alternative splicing data derived from rMATS-merged TSV files. The workflows facilitate the integration, normalization, and annotation of splicing events, ensuring consistency and reproducibility in downstream analyses. Additionally, the repository supports data transformation for compatibility with statistical modeling, visualization, and functional interpretation of differential splicing patterns."

- name: "Automated Germline Variant Pathogenicity (AutoGVP)"
  url: "https://github.com/diskin-lab-chop/AutoGVP"
  description: "Tool that integrates germline variant pathogenicity annotations from ClinVar and sequence variant classifications from a modified version of InterVar (PVS1 strength adjustments, removal of PP5/BP6). This tool facilitates large-scale, clinically-focused classification of germline sequence variants in a research setting."
